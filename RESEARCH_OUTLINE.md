# Research Project Outline: EmotiCare

| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | This research explores the development and impact of an AI-powered mental wellness companion, "EmotiCare." The project investigates the use of multimodal AI to provide accessible, private, and empathetic support for mental well-being. Key topics include sentiment analysis, multimodal emotion recognition (from simulated facial, vocal, and textual inputs), and the application of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles in a conversational AI. |
| **Background and Motivation** | There is a growing global need for accessible mental health support. Many individuals face barriers such as cost, stigma, or lack of available professionals. This research is motivated by the potential of technology to bridge this gap. The project aims to create a tool that offers a private and non-judgmental space for users to track their emotional state, reflect through journaling, and engage with a supportive AI, making daily mental wellness practices more attainable. |
| **Relevance and Importance** | This research will contribute new insights into designing user-centric, multimodal AI systems for mental wellness. Its relevance lies in demonstrating a practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for empathetic, CBT-informed interaction. The findings will be important for developers, UI/UX designers, and mental health professionals interested in leveraging technology to create scalable and supportive wellness tools. The project emphasizes a privacy-first approach, which is critical in this domain. |
| **Literature review** | The proposed work builds upon existing research in several areas: 1) Affective Computing, focusing on emotion detection from text, voice, and facial expressions. 2) Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis in digital journaling. 3) The application of LLMs and conversational AI in mental health, particularly chatbots designed around therapeutic frameworks like CBT. This project seeks to integrate these areas into a single, cohesive web application. |
| **Objectives** | 1. To develop a web application, EmotiCare, that provides a suite of mental wellness tools. 2. To implement a multimodal mood check-in feature using simulated camera, microphone, and text inputs for a holistic mood prediction. 3. To create an AI chat companion that provides supportive, non-judgmental responses based on CBT principles. 4. To build a digital journal with AI-powered sentiment analysis to help users identify emotional patterns. 5. To design an intuitive and empathetic user interface that prioritizes privacy and user trust. |
| **Required Tools and Technology** | **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) <br> **UI:** React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS <br> **Language:** TypeScript <br> **Generative AI:** Google Gemini via Genkit <br> **Development:** Node.js, npm/yarn <br> **Deployment:** Vercel / Cloud Hosting Provider |
| **Method/ Approach** | The project follows an agile development methodology. The approach is feature-driven, focusing on building and integrating individual components (Dashboard, Check-in, Journal, Chat, Support). The core AI functionality is built using Genkit, which orchestrates calls to the Google Gemini model. Server Actions in Next.js are used to securely handle communication between the client-side components and the server-side AI flows, ensuring API keys and sensitive logic are not exposed. The UI is constructed with reusable React components for maintainability. |
